# Features

Recent work completed the initial roadmap in `docs/TASKS.md`. Momentum flow line tracing now supports adaptive step sizes and threshold-based termination. The [intro notebook](../notebooks/intro.ipynb) demonstrates these capabilities together with plots of the kinematic scalars.

Solver routines were also optimised using a small Rust extension. The resulting speed ups are showcased in [rust_demo.ipynb](../notebooks/rust_demo.ipynb).

Further enhancements are planned; consult `docs/TASKS.md` for details and upcoming milestones.
