# Upcoming Features

The project roadmap mirrors the enhancements outlined in `docs/TASKS.md`. New functionality such as improved momentum flow line tracing and additional solver optimizations will be documented here as the implementations land.

For now, refer to the PDF `docs/2102.06824v2.pdf` for theoretical background and check the tasks file to track development progress. When a feature is complete the relevant notebook will be updated and referenced from this guide.
