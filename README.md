# PyWarp

Pywarp is a set of functions and methods to evaluate warp drive spacetimes using Einstein's theory of General Relativity inspired by Warp Factory https://github.com/NerdsWithAttitudes/WarpFactory as a numerical process.

PyWarp is a Python package for calculating the energy tensor from a given metric tensor using Einstein's Field Equations. This package provides a set of functions to compute various tensors, including the Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Einstein tensor, and the energy density tensor.

## Installation

To install PyWarp, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pywarp.git
cd pywarp
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Usage

To use PyWarp, you can import the necessary functions and pass the required parameters. Here is an example:
```
import numpy as np
from warp.solver.get_energy_tensor import get_energy_tensor

tensor = np.zeros((4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2))

# Define the values for the diagonal elements
values = [-1, 1, 1, 1]

# Assign values to the diagonal elements for all combinations of the last four indices
for idx in range(4):
    tensor[idx, idx, :, :, :, :] = values[idx]

metric = {
    'type': "Metric",
    'tensor': tensor,
    'coords': "cartesian",
    'index': "covariant",
    'scaling': [1, 1, 1, 1],
    'name': "Minkowski"
}

energy = get_energy_tensor(metric, diffOrder='fourth')

print("Energy Tensor:", energy)
```

## Building the Rust extension

The `c4_inv` routine is implemented in Rust for improved performance. After
installing the Python dependencies run:

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

This compiles the `warp_core` crate and makes it available to Python.

# pywarp


Using numpy and matrix operations where possible to keep it fast.
starting in primarly python but going to make use of rust or bend where speed is needed.

Goal is to get jupyter notebooks able to explore things
